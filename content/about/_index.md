## Why climbing  

Climbing exposes us to a range of emotions such as fear, frustration, pride, and joy; and to manage these emotions we need to learn self control, balance, patience and commitment. At DreamHigher, we believe that this journey leads to growth and emotional balance

Our home of Cape Town, South Africa is one of the world's premier rock climbing destinations, with an alomst endless array of high quality boulders, sport and traditional climbing routes. Within a few hours drive lies the bouldering mecca of Rocklands, visited by the best climbers in the world every year

The emotional benefits of climbing, the strong bonds within the climbing community, and exposure to the beauty of the natural world make this sport an ideal opportunity to build bridges occurs social divides, connect youth with their natural heritage and heal the damage inflicted by violence, substance abuse and poverty on the youth of Cape Town.

## How we started  

Recognizing these benefits, a small group of local climbers approached the Homestead Project for Street Children and proposed to introduce the youth under their care to climbing. 

[The Homestead Project for Street Children](http://homestead.org.za/) is a Cape Town based non-profit addressing to the plight of children living, working and begging on the streets of Cape Town. 
  
We now offer multiple indoor coaching sessions a week for vulnerable youth from the Homestead and other facilities at Cape Town's premier indoor bouldering gym [Bloc 11](http://www.bloc11.co.za), with input from some of South Africa's top climbing coaches. We also have regular outdoor days, bouldering and sport climbing around the Cape Peninsula under the supervision of experienced climbing guides.
