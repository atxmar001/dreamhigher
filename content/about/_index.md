## Why climbing  

Climbing exposes us to a range of emotions:  fear, frustration, pride, and joy; and to manage these emotions we need to learn self control, balance, patience and commitment. We at DreamHigher believe that this journey leads to growth and emotional balance  
  
Our goal is to share the these benfits and the pure joy of climbing with vulnerable youth in Cape Town, South Africa

## How we started  

Recognizing the benefits that climbing offers to vulnerable youth, a small group of local climbers approached the Homestead Project for Street Children and proposed to introduce the youth under their care to climbing. 
  
We now offer multiple indoor coaching sessions a week with input from some of South Africa's top climbing coaches, and bi-monthly outdoor days, boldering and sport climbing around the Cape Peninsula under the supervision of experienced climbing guides
