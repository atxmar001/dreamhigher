Clmibing exposes us to a range of emotions:  fear, frustration, pride, and joy; and to manage these emotions we need to learn self control, balance, patience and commitment. We at DreamHigher believe that this journey leads to growth and emotional balance and want to share the these benfits and the pure joy of climbing with at-risk youth in Cape Town.

It is with this framework in mind that a bunch of local climbers approached the youth of the Homestead Project for Street Children and proposed to share with them the joy of climbing. From this initiative, July 2017, was born DreamHigher. 

Bloc 11 and Vertigo Gear & Adventures kindly provided a home for us: offering access for the club to their world-class bouldering gym and donating gear for club members.

DreamHigher now offers two coached sessions per week of indoor bouldering at Bloc 11 and outdoor rock-climbing twice per month to disadvantaged youth.

DreamHigher is affiliated with Western Cape Climbing and South African National Climbing Federations
