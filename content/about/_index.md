## Our mission

Our goal is to bring rock climbing to the vulnerable youth of Cape
Town, building confidence, bridging social divides and forming connections with the natural world

## What we do

#### Indoor bouldering session
We organise multiple indoor coaching sessions a week for vulnerable youth from youth homes around Cape Town at the city's premier indoor bouldering gym Bloc 11. We follow a training plan developed by our head training adviser Michelle Albertyn and our sessions are guided by experienced climbers who regularly invite some of South Africaâ€™s top climbers to join the fun  

#### Outdoor climbing days
We have regular outdoor days in the month, bouldering and sport climbing around the Cape Peninsula under the supervision of experienced climbing guides  

#### Introduction to climbing afternoons
We offer to local outreach social initiatives working with vulnerable youth an introduction to climbing as a recreational activity so that their kids can come discover what is the sport about, have fun and test themselves against the problems. These events are hosted at Bloc 11 on a weekend afternoon, they are designed for groups of 10-15 youth who will be guided by experienced climbing coaches and our most committed team members. 
If you are involved with such social initiatives and would like to explore the possibility to collaborate, kindly get in touch with us.

## Why climbing  

Climbing exposes us to a range of emotions such as fear, frustration, pride, and joy; and to manage these emotions we need to learn self control, balance, patience and commitment. At DreamHigher, we believe that this journey leads to growth and emotional balance

Our home of Cape Town, South Africa is one of the world's premier rock climbing destinations, with an almost endless array of high quality boulders, sport and traditional climbing routes. Within a few hours drive lies the bouldering mecca of Rocklands, visited by the best climbers in the world every year

The emotional benefits of climbing, the strong bonds within the climbing community, and exposure to the beauty of the natural world make this sport an ideal opportunity to build bridges across social divides, connect youth with their natural heritage and heal the damage inflicted by violence, substance abuse and poverty on the youth of Cape Town.

## How we started  

Recognizing these benefits, a small group of local climbers approached the Homestead Project for Street Children and proposed to introduce the youth under their care to climbing. 

[The Homestead Project for Street Children](http://homestead.org.za/) is a Cape Town based non-profit addressing to the plight of children living, working and begging on the streets of Cape Town.

With the support of [Bloc 11](http://www.bloc11.co.za) and [Vertigo adventures](https://vertigoadventures.co.za) we were provided with a world class bouldering facility from which to run our programme and top quality gear to equip our climbers
