Are you planning to enter the Summer Boulder league at Bloc 11? Good news if you’re looking for beginner climber to form your team! Our DreamHigher guys are super amped to join the fun and are looking for teams. This is a great opportunity for you to get to know the DreamHigher team, and help them on their journey to becoming confident, strong climbers.
Sibo, Denis, Eric, Patrick, Thurlow are available for at least 3-5 Thursdays. Glenn and Margaux have already offered a spot on their team so we are looking for our guys to join 4 more teams! We will randomise the matches once we have the other teams confirmed.
Keen to have one of the guys on your team? Don’t be shy and contact us [here](./contact)
