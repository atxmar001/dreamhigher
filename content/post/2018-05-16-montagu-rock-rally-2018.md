Every April the South African climbing community decends on the small town on Montagu in the Western Cape of South Africa to sample some of the finest sport climbing the country has to offer. This annual event is highly anticipated, and involves a weekend of camping, fancy dress, rock climbing, and an infamous closing party.   
  
DreamHigher came out in force this year entering three climbing teams into the competition. Our crew had so much fun on their first proper lead day, braving their fear and pushing themselves. Their dedication was rewarded by prizes and smiles! Congratulations to all of them!  
  
We are extremely grateful to the Montagu Rock Rally 2018 for sponsoring our participation, to De Bos Guest Farm Montagu for offering us a campground, to Vertigo Adventures for the gear, City ROCK Cape Town for granting us access to the gym in prep of the event and to the Homestead for the fantastic job they do! Well done to organizers Jed Johnson and Rio Button for putting together a great event!  
  
See you next year!
