We are calling for the support of the climbing community to raise funds to help one of our most talented climbers, Obert. Obert is currently stateless (no birth certificate, no ID, no passport). Despite recently completing his schooling his status as stateless means he is unable to find legitimate employment and realize his full potential. He has been one of the most active members of ourclub from its foundation in 2017. His progression and incredible positivity despite his circumstances keep inspiring us and our local climbing community. 
His previous unsuccessful attempts to return to Zimbabwe and obtain documentation have exposed him to traumatic and dangerous conditions. We want to ensure that he is able to safely journey to Zimbabwe and return home to Cape Town to start his tertiary education and keep climbing!

Please donate to our campaing to raise money for his journey through  [givengain](https://www.givengain.com/c/dreamhigher/).
