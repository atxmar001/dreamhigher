At the end of the 2017-2018 Summer boulder league, DreamHigher was able to award the dedication shown by our most commited members to date. While we are very fortunate to be hosted by [bloc 11](https://bloc11.co.za/) twice a week, we all know that to truly excel as climbers we need full access to top class facilities and gear. [Bloc 11](https://bloc11.co.za/) generously donated four full memberships for 2018 to DreamHigher and [Mad Rock](https://madrock.com/) gifted each climber with new climbing shoes. 

We our very proud of the commitment shown by our guys and are very excited to see them training regularly. Big thanks to [Bloc 11](https://bloc11.co.za/) and [Mad Rock](https://madrock.com/) for their continued support.

If you bump into them at [Bloc 11](https://bloc11.co.za/) be sure to give them a fistbump and share some beta
