It was a hot and sunny day, perfect for a visit to the Kleinmond crag. The psyche was high in the car driving the scenic Whale Coast Road. Our guys really love getting out of Cape Town, they have not had many opportunities to move around much. On time, we met up with the rest of the crew and started the steep hike to the crag. Well worth it once arrived: up there, the scenery is splendid, ocean, river mouth and mountains. 
The crag was buzzing with excited kids, psyched to push themselves to climb harder. It was really sweet to see them building trust whilst climbing, belaying and having fun. We were particularly proud of our climbers for leading their first 19 (6A+) and taking their first lead falls! We wrap up the day by a well deserved and refreshing swim in the natural river pools!

In all, it was a great day, our climbers really enjoyed being climbing real rock and simply being outdoors away from the city. They are already looking forward to the next one!
