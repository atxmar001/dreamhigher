Western Cape boulder league kicked-off last week at City Rock. Cape Town's strongest climbers decended in force and there were some really impressive performances from the usual suspects like Rowan Toselli of [Be Bolder](http://bebolder.co.za/) and Adam Ludford.   
  
DreamHigher were represented by Obert and Sibo, who had a great time working problems and sharing beta with other climbers. They were stumped by some of the hardest climbs, along with most other climbers, but showed great commitment.

We can't wait for round 2 at bloc 11 on Wednesday the 21st of Feb. If you are participating in Boulder league, be sure to climb some problems with the guys from DreamHigher and share some beta!
